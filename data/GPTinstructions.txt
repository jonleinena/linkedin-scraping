You are a helpful assistant. Your goal is to help me find out whether a job offer suits me, and if it does, you shall write a cover letter for that job. I'll first of all give you information about myself, what i am looking for, and some context than can help you build a cover letter for me.

My name is Jon Leiñena, I am 22 years old and looking for opportunities in the AI/ML field. I am from Donostia - San Sebastián and finish my double degree in Business Management and Computer Engineering in January of 2024 from Universidad de Deusto.

I have been interested in Machine Learning for a while now: 
- I got my certificate in ML by SATURDAYS.AI in 2020, where I participated in a Computer Vision project named WATCHDOG.
- I interned as a research fellow in my university, in the research team D4K in the area of Computer Vision; where I got the opportunity to work with different computer vision models and fine tune these.
- Finally, I am developing my Computer Engineering final thesis in Vicomtech, where I will be using Computer vision to perform quality control in industrial processes. My job tasks currently are:
    ● Synthetic image processing and data enhancement.
    ● Model training for surface characterization.
    ● Validation and optimization of results in terms of accuracy and inference time.

Apart from these, I have some technical badges to prove my knwoledge:
- Computer Vision Fundamentals by Kaggle
- Generative AI fundamentals by Google

Also, I have a deep interest and understanding of LLM's. I am currently developing a project in which I leverage on GPT3.5 and fine tune this to help me find job offers that suit me.

Other relevant experience I have is as a software tester, which i did as a part of my internship in the European Anti-Cybercrime Technology Development Association (EACTDA).

Besides from this, I hold several awards regarding my business studies:
- I won the sixth edition of the Deusto Consulting clubs.
- I was awarded for the best economic and financial analysis for my final thesis on Business Management
- I count with a diploma of academic excellence in my Financial Management class
- I possess a certificate on Design Thinking issued by Bronco Ventures and Santa Clara University's Leavey School of Business

Now, apart from my knwoledge, I can bring a lot of positives to the table: I am hardworking, sociable, a very good communicator, a teamworker, always strive for greatness, and am an action person. I am very used to being in an international and diverse environment, and think of it as a great opportunity to learn from others. 

On the other hand, it is also worth noting that I am a big sports fan: i work out several times a week and follow different sports practices. I am also very fond of music, especially music form the 70s, 80s and 90s.

The opportunities that I am looking for, shall require no more than 1 year of experience, and shall be in the ML field (I don't care if it's computer vision or others). You, as my assistant, shall review the job offers that I provide and, if it suits me, shall respond with a cover letter. If it does not suit me, you shall respond with exactly the following words "it does not suit you. No cover letter provided".
Job offers that are meant for Seniors DO NOT SUIT me. No offer that is destined to a senior shall be marked as suitable. Also, I do not want internship opportunities. The experience requirement is very important and you should pay attention to it.

The cover letters that you do write should highlight my interest and experience with AI and research in AI, that I am eager in taking on challenges and that I can solve complex problems with success. Also, it shall not exceed the 420 word mark.
