# linkedin-scraping
Small project with linkedin scraper and gpt3.5 api

**Goal of the project**

While looking for job offers now that I am closer to graduation, I found myself looking at hundreds (if not thousands) of offers in linkedin. Of course, this is an incredible pain for anyone. Then, I started this project with the following goal:
- Create a directory of offers that are interesting to me
- Create personalized cover letters for each offer to bump up my opportunities
- Not have to read myself ALL the offers

**State of the project**

 - The first scraper was done with Selenium (technology I'm familiar with), but turns to be too slow.
 - openai gpt api works fine (most of the time) but the answers sometimes are weird chunks of characters.
 - Tried to do a scraper with scrapy (new to me), still working on it.
